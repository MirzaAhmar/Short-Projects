This project is a simple password strength checker built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to type a password and receive real-time feedback on its strength. The strength is indicated through color-coded bars (weak, medium, and strong) and a descriptive message. Users can also toggle the visibility of the password with a "Show" or "Hide" button. The project demonstrates basic form handling, regular expressions for password validation, and dynamic styling.

Features:
Password strength indicator with color feedback.
Real-time validation based on password length and complexity.
Toggle password visibility with a button.
Responsive design for mobile compatibility.
This project is a great starting point for learning about form validation and password security.
